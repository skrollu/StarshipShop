## TODO:

-   [ ] Only ask for id for DTO, entity name is useless and can result in bugs... only the id is used today
-   [ ] Change the response of each endpoints in a more complete one {meta, links, response} and the delete response.
-   [x] AccountService register must return SecurityUserDetail and need to be fully tested.
-   [x] Replace Sysout by slf4j
-   [x] see sonar fix recommandation and go up to 50% of code coverage to be able to push code
-   [x] Install SonarLint
-   [x] Had permission system over Authorities.
-   [x] Secure existing endpoints
