## TODO:

-   Only ask for id for DTO entity name is useless and can result in bugs... only the id is used today
-   Change the response of each endpoints in a more complete one {meta, links, response} and the delete response.

### 08-29-2022:

-   Add a salt variable to a brand new serializer that uses the id/hash converters. Ids/Hashs now works both with hateoas links and JsonSerialization.

### 08-14-2022:

-   Refactoring des endpoints sur le modÃ¨le des manufacturers

### 08-09-2022:

-   Found why there was a compilation error because of lombok not working: pom.xml -> The plugin part needed to be change to work with both lombok and mapstruct.
